# WindPowerEstimation
The WindPowerEstimation repository is a library of functions for calculating variables related to wind resources and wind power

Short description of the functions:

- WIND_calc_WndShear.m: Calculates the vertical wind shear

- WIND_calc_WeibullParams.m: Calculates theWeibull shape, scale and standard deviation

- WIND_calc_AbsRampRate.m: Calculates the absolute wind speed and wind power ramp-rates

- WIND_calc_WndPowerDensity.m: Calculates the energy density in the air

- WIND_calc_PowerDeliver.m: Calculates the wind power delivered by the air stream to the turbine rotor

- WIND_calc_PowerCaptureCoeff.m: Calculates the efficiency of a turbine in extracting the energy content of an air stream

- WIND_calc_TurbinePowerProd.m: Calculates wind power production for a selected turbine and method

- WIND_calc_FullLoadHours.m: Calculates the full load hours for a selected turbine

- WIND_calc_CapacityFactor.m: Calculates the wind power capacity factor for a selected turbine

- WIND_calc_PercCubedProd.m: Calculates the time share the power production is a function of the wind speed cubed

- WIND_calc_PercRatedProd.m: Calculates the time share the power production is rated

- WIND_calc_PercZeroProd.m: Calculates the time share the power production is zero

- WIND_calc_WndDirSector.m: Calculates the mean of the prevailing wind-direction sector


Equations and a more detailed description of the calculations are given in the papers below.
